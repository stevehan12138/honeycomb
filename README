# HoneycombLang
Honeycomb is a interpreted programming language, currently WIP as my personal project. 
I want to use this as an opportunity to learn Rust and how languages work in general. Advices and suggestions are welcomed!
The file extension for now is .comb, but may change later.
The syntax is still a work in progress, there will be more detailed documentation as the language grows. Currently, the goal is to have a similar syntax as Python, with added feature that I like from Typescript, Rust, etc.

## Goals
The language is written in Rust and interpreted. The goal is to create a Turing complete programming languages with many features like loops, if statements, functions, etc.

## Current Progress
- [x] basic arithmetic
- [x] i32 only variable
- [ ] if statement
- [ ] string literal
- [ ] for statement
